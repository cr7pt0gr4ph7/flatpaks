# flatpaks
Custom Flatpaks for applications not available on Flathub
A few Flatpaks for applications that weren't available on Flathub, but which I wanted to use on my immutable [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.org/)-based system.
Inspired by [tinywrkb/flatpaks](https://github.com/tinywrkb/flatpaks) and based on the [andyholmes/flatter](https://github.com/andyholmes/flatter) GitHub action and [flatpak-builder](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder).

Not tested in any meaningful way except for "works on my machine", so use at your own discretion.
